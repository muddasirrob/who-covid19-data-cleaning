Data Cleaning on WHO COVID-19 Dataset
Project Overview
This project focuses on Data Cleaning and Preprocessing of the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 dataset, a real-world dataset that includes country-wise COVID-19 statistics. The dataset contains data such as total confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, active cases, and more. The goal is to handle missing values, remove duplicates, fix inconsistencies, and prepare the data for future analysis or modeling.

Key Objectives:
Data Cleaning: Identify and handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistent or incorrect entries.

Preprocessing: Convert categorical variables into numerical ones, standardize data formats, and prepare the dataset for downstream tasks.

Exploratory Overview: Generate basic statistics and visual summaries to understand the overall structure of the cleaned dataset.

Insight Extraction: Identify key metrics and patterns relevant to pandemic trends like death rate, recovery rate, or cases per population.

Technologies Used
Python

Pandas: For data manipulation and handling missing data.

NumPy: For numerical operations and data standardization.

Jupyter Notebook: For documenting the cleaning and analysis process.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the WHO COVID-19 Dataset, which provides country-level data on pandemic-related metrics. The dataset includes columns such as:

Country: Name of the country.

Total Cases, Total Deaths, Total Recovered, Active Cases.

Population, Death Rate, Recovery Rate, Serious/Critical.

Cases per Million, Deaths per Million, and more.

Steps Involved
Data Loading: Load the WHO COVID-19 dataset and explore its basic structure.

Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates, fill or drop missing values, and fix inconsistencies.

Data Preprocessing: Encode categorical data, correct column formats, and clean irrelevant or malformed data entries.

Descriptive Statistics: Calculate summary statistics for key numerical features.

Basic Analysis: Use groupings and metrics like mean, median, or ratios to understand global COVID-19 impact.
