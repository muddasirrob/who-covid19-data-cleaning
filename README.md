🧹 Data Cleaning on WHO COVID-19 Dataset
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on data cleaning and preprocessing of the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 dataset, which contains real-world data related to global COVID-19 statistics. The dataset includes country-wise information on total cases, deaths, recoveries, and more.

The objective is to transform the raw dataset into a clean and structured format suitable for data analysis or machine learning tasks by handling missing values, removing duplicates, fixing inconsistencies, and encoding categorical data.

🎯 Key Objectives
Data Cleaning:

Remove duplicates

Handle missing values appropriately

Correct inconsistent data entries (e.g., formatting issues)

Preprocessing:

Convert categorical variables into numerical formats

Normalize and format date/time fields if applicable

Prepare the dataset for downstream tasks like EDA or ML modeling

Insight Extraction:

Generate basic statistics and summary of cleaned data

Identify any unusual patterns, trends, or outliers in the dataset

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas – For data cleaning and manipulation

NumPy – For numerical computations

Jupyter Notebook – For interactive data cleaning and exploration
