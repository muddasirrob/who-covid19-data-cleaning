# **Data Cleaning on WHO COVID-19 Dataset**

## **Project Overview**

This project performs **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing** on the **World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 dataset** to prepare it for further analysis. The dataset contains global country-wise statistics on COVID-19 such as total confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases. The objective is to clean and standardize the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting data types, and performing initial preprocessing for effective downstream analysis.

## **Key Objectives:**
- **Data Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing values, remove duplicate entries, and correct inconsistencies within the dataset.
- **Preprocessing**: Convert categorical variables to numerical (if needed), standardize formats, and structure the dataset for analysis or modeling.
- **Exploratory Overview**: Generate basic statistics and understand the structure and distribution of the dataset.
- **Insight Extraction**: Identify key features such as recovery rate, death rate, and active cases that help in understanding the pandemic trends.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and cleaning
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for step-by-step analysis and interactivity

## **Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is the **WHO COVID-19 Dataset**, which includes up-to-date global COVID-19 statistics by country. Key columns in the dataset include:

- `Country`: Country name
- `Total Cases`, `Total Deaths`, `Total Recovered`, `Active Cases`
- `Death Rate`, `Recovery Rate`, `Serious/Critical`
- `Population`, `Cases per Million`, `Deaths per Million`

## **Steps Involved**
1. **Data Loading** – Load and examine the raw dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Fix missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize column formats.
3. **Data Preprocessing** – Convert types, structure columns, and prepare data for analysis.
4. **Summary Statistics** – Display basic statistical summaries of cleaned data.
5. **Initial Analysis** – Understand key metrics such as death rate, recovery rate, and overall country-level comparisons.
